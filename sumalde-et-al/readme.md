## Abstract

Conflict Incidents in ARMM (Security - Conflict Incidents in ARMM (Conflict Alert 2015).zip )are critical data that would tell us the realities of the Bangsamoro. A proper data visualization dashboard would help us get a better understanding of the general trends, and a way to track and look the data at various angle - data wise.

SleekOps hopes to offer a Cloud Based Dashboard using this data set.
