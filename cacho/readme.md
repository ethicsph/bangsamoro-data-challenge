# Bangsamoro Data Challenge: Cacho

## Abstract

ARMM has been the center of rebellion and war crimes for decades. Using the data from Bangsamoro and other open data on the internet, I will at least enlighten the people about the region, especially the things they acquired from fake news and alike. Opportunities for the region's provinces will be provided and invite others to participate in making the new ARMM sooner.
