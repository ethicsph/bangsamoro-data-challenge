*Presentation*, Copra Meal: As an Alternative Feeds for Fishery

## Abstract

Evident transitions that is taking place in a community provides the real-life societal and environmental issues sitting within a locality that is needed to be resolved by long-term solutions. Starting from a place of knowledge helps understand the context and consider the best course of action to take. These courses of action are realized and the contemplation of the issues are identified and addressed as data and statistics come in play to relay important information that allows to compare past to future findings in order to seek probable solutions to the presented problem. To the best of its knowledge, this paper explored the case of poverty and unemployment in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and proposed a livelihood that is best fit to the community to resolve the issue.

Poverty remains to be a problem that the Philippines continues to combat in the past 4 decades. In 2015, 21.6% of the population belongs to the national poverty line. In fish farming, BARMM contributes nearly 30% of the overall fish production in the whole Philippines with Tawi-Tawi being its main source. However, while there was an increase of 240% in the production of tilapia in 2001-2011, only 7% was the production increase in 2007-2016. This solely shows that there is a wide gap of reduction in farmed tilapia production. The major causes for the decrease were identified as high water temperature (68%), lack of government assistance (58%), poor breed of tilapia (48%), high cost of production (46%), and lack of capital (44%).

It is accounted that over 60%-70% of the costs to feed tilapia are due to the imported feeds. A study was conducted about a protein-enriched copra meal that was able to reduce feed use by 20–30% and lessened feed cost by 18–29%. In terms of agriculture, the percentage share of production of major crops in BARMM is extensive in cassava (45.6%), coffee (12.2%), corn (10.96%), rubber (9.2%), and coconut (8.3%). Since coconut is the 5th major production crops of BARMM, there is a huge possibility to make “Copra” in region and supply it to fishing industry instead of importing feeds.

Creating and distributing own products will not only benefit in having low cost production but also for sustainability of livelihood. This is a study that presents an idea on how to battle poverty and possible solution is to increase the growth of the economy.
