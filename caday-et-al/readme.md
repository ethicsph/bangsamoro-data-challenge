# Bangsamoro Data Challenge: Caday, et. al. 

## Abstract

The research is about rubber from Rubber Tree (Hevea brasiliensis) as a strengthening agent for road reconstruction in Bangsamoro. The study aims 1) To provide a strengthening agent for road reconstruction using rubber tree from rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis).2) To assess potential livelihood from rubber industry for economic growth in terms of: a. National Identity and Festivity b. Business and Marketing of Rubber – based products c.Tourism. The study is a descriptive type of research wherein the researchers used a bibliographic approach in the assessment of the rubber industry’s economic effect. In addition, data about the Bangsamoro were gathered through the Open Bangsamoro Data files which contributed to the understanding of the current situation of Bangsamoro. This led to the introduction of National Identity for Bangsamoro. The researchers came up with a technique in rebuilding Bangsamoro, industrially and economically, and the main subject of the research is rubber. Since Bangsamoro came from a state of war and abundant in the area, rubbles of debris and waste material can be used as a strengthening agent for pavements. The results of the study come up with a solution to strengthen the qualities of asphalt, and by the mixing of natural rubber, which came from rubber trees. Due to the elasticity and shear resistance of rubber, the flow of roads during high temperature can be prevented and deformation is highly unlikely, thus, allowing it to be prolonged and maintained (Azahar, 2016). Furthermore, traffic noise can also be reduced as the experts reckon that it is because of the acquired thickness and springiness from the rubber. Also, this mixture can improve a water drainage property which is of course beneficial to places prone to flooding (Cimons, 2014).
