# Bangsamoro Data Challenge: Porras and Bruno 

## Abstract

Mindanao is one of my interests growing up in Manila and the Bangsomoro Data will help me understand and know the current status of Bangsomoro. With these data, I will create a Community Based Monitoring Dashboard for Bangsomoro that includes data in education, health, economy, inflation rate and employment rates, demographics and etc. I will use Tableau Software in analyzing the data and giving insights to the respective indicators. Also, given a chance, I will try to answer some problems happening to Bangsomoro.
