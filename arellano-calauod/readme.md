*Research Paper*, May the Work Force be with BARMM: An Analysis of Labor Force Participation Rates

## Abstract

Abstract â€“ Labor force participation rate (LFPR) in BARMM has always been below the national average and ranking last in all regions. For this project, LFPR was disaggregated by age, gender, and municipality. This aims to determine if there exists spatial correlation of LFPR, observe its behavior, and incorporate the demographics of the labor force. Explanatory data analysis and local spatial autocorrelation were performed. It was found that early and prime mature working age LFPR are both high. The high early working age LFPR indicates that individuals join the labor force at an early age. This is reflected in the education level of the labor force since majority of them reached until elementary and high school level only. Disparity in the male and female LFPR was also identified and may be related to the prevalent early marriage in the region and the lack of job opportunities for women, specifically in the agricultural sector which is the main livelihood in the region. Hence, groups and areas with low-performing LFPR should be further investigated.
