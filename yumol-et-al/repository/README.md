# Bangsamoro Open Data Challenge

Previous studies show that BARMM has a higher than average student dropout rate in the country. At the primary level, boys tend to leave school which eventually leads to worsening gender disparities as students get promoted to a higher level of education. It is reported that factors such as lack of interest and the rising cost of education make the students leave school. These can be further broken down by identifying indicators and key features that affect dropout rates such as early employment, security issues, and health care access among others. With these, we aim to make a model and a map that will guide the policymakers and stakeholders to know where, when, and how they would set their priorities in improving student retention rates in the region. The model will predict dropout rates per granularity of barangay and identify the cause. In the absence of data, the model can also be used to augment information by geographical clustering. The map will provide an interactive storytelling guide for data communication and translation.
