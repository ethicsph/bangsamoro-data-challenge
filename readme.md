# Bangsamoro Data Challenge

## Background

The [Bangsamoro Data Challenge](https://ethics.ph/openbangsamoro/) was announced during the [Inaugural Data Ethics Meetup](https://ethics.ph/inaugural/) on November 2019 inviting data analysts, data scientists, application developers, students, and faculty to pitch in their ideas for social good through data and technology on the [Open Bangsamoro datasets](https://www.openbangsamoro.com/).

Open Bangsamoro was a collaborative initiative of [The Asia Foundation](https://asiafoundation.org/), [UK FCO](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office), and the [Regional Government of Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao](https://bangsamoro.gov.ph/) as part of the preparation for the transition to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Open Bangsamoro contains data, maps, and other information relevant to the transition and is open to the public.

[Data Ethics PH](https://ethics.ph/) was formed to promote, discuss, and assess the ethical use of data and technology in the Philippines. We are joined by wide group of technologists, data scientists, social impact advocates, and students all with a passion to drive social impact using data and technology.
