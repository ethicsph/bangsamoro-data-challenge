# Bangsamoro Data Challenge: Puspus

## Abstract

Mindanao is the most seismically active major island in the Philippines. This study investigates how ARMM is (and will be) affected by earthquakes. I'll start by showing major historical earthquakes and their respective locations all throughout ARMM. Then I'll show which cities, road networks and seaports most susceptible to damage from earthquakes and tsunamis, and which ones aren't. I'll tie the analysis and visuals together through an online interactive and animated web application for ease of exploration, tracking and discovery.
