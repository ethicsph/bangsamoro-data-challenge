## Abstract

The production of plastic had brought tremendous changes in fields such as manufacturing and production. While plastics are very useful, they come with negative impacts on the environment. In this regard, scientists have opted for renewable sources to be converted into bioplastics. Bioplastics have been the focus of various researches due to their low-cost production, high affordability, eco-friendliness, and organic decomposition properties. Currently, bioplastic supply around the world is considerably less, and demands for bioplastics have tremendously increased in the last years, making bioplastics one of the most sought-for products. As these demands increase, so is the need to look for other biological renewable sources that could replace synthetic materials, and one of them is seaweed. Bangsamoro, also known as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, or BARMM, is an autonomous region within the southern Philippines known as the countryâ€™s largest leading seaweed producer, primarily of the species Kappaphycus alvarezii (Tambalang) and Eucheuma denticulatum (Guso). The researchers aim to (1) propose a sustainable source of livelihood for the people in BARMM by means of converting locally-produced seaweed (Kappaphycus alvarezii and Eucheuma denticulatum) to bioplastics, (2) initiate a bioplastic industry that would bring local jobs for the people to increase economic growth and engage BARMM towards becoming the country's leading bioplastic provider, and (3) promote environmental sustainability and protection through enriching their aquaculture and maximizing the use of seaweeds. The researchers have found out that producing bioplastics made from locally-produced species of seaweed would be advantageous for the people considering their geographic location and abundance of aquaculture skills and resources. This would produce local jobs that would boost their economy, engaging BARMM towards the bioplastic industry which would open opportunities for maximizing growth potential. It would also help preserve their environment by putting these microalgae into sustainable use. Although seaweed bioplastics are still in the research phase of becoming more durable, seaweed bioplastics still pave the way towards attaining local sustainability and development.
