*Research Paper*, Do OOSY What I See?: An Analysis of the Out-of-School Youth Rate in the BARMM

## Abstract

Abstract—The BARMM is a region that struggles when it comes to education, having the highest OOSY rate among Philippine regions. This study aims to examine OOSY rate for ages 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 in the region, and the factors affecting them. OOSY rate was related to education, demographic, and socioeconomic features. Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial regression, and XGBoost models were fit and compared. Three prominent features appeared in all final models: floor area per household, no. of teachers per school, and proportion of married male youth. The selected features per age group model suggest that housing and living conditions are more predictive for younger children, “adult” matters like marriage and household size are more predictive for older children. The municipalities of Marogong, Tapul, and Sitangkai were identified as outlying across all models; their OOSY rates were consistently underestimated at all age groups. Overall, results suggest that the region take a more holistic approach in the improvement of OOSY, taking into account the home environment and living conditions.
