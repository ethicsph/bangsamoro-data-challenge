## Title

*Research Paper*, Analysis of Gun Usage in BARMM Conflicts

## Abstract

Abstract — Many gun-related disputes, hostilities, rebellions, and terrorism are barriers to the development efforts being conducted to prepare the region for its impending autonomy. Gun-related incidents are proportionate to the emerging extremism. Tracking conflict incidence and weapon usage, especially of firearms, will aid authorities in identifying at-risk areas and improve the peace & order situation in the region. This study analyzes whether gun-related incidents in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) consist of patterns that determines which areas are prevalent of conflicts. The researchers make use of the data analytics tool, Tableau, in mapping the events on the different municipalities of its five provinces, Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. Results revealed that Cotabato City in Maguindanao’s capital has the highest recorded number of conflict incidents. Moreover, .17 and .30 centerfire and/or rimfire for caliber and start rifles are the most used weapons in BARMM conflicts. Lastly, conflict incidence is reflective of the state of current events in BARMM.
