# Bangsamoro Data Challenge: Tingzon 

## Title

*Abstract*, Geospatial Analysis Platform for Humanitarian Orgs and Local Government

## Abstract

With the Open Bangsamoro Dataset, we envision a geospatial analysis platform optimized to help humanitarian organizations and local government units in BARMM make smarter, more evidence-based decisions.

As a proof-of-concept, we present our solution as a system consisting of two main components:
* Interactive dashboard that shows relevant information and important insights for decision-makers
* AI-generated maps to augment official statistics and optimal facility placement schemes to aid development plans in BARMM.
